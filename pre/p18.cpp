/*
q1. Compare runtime and compile-time polymorphism with suitable examples.

ans. Runtime polymorphism is achieved using function overriding, which involves inheritance and virtual functions. The decision about which method to call is made at runtime.
Compile-time polymorphism is achieved using function overloading and operator overloading. The decision about which method to call is made at compile time.


q2. Classify operators in C++ with examples.

ans. 
Arithmetic Operators: + - * / %
Relational Operators: == != > < >= <=
Logical Operators: && || !
Bitwise Operators: & | ^ ~ << >>
Assignment Operators: = += -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=
Ternary Operator: ? :
Increment & Decrement Operators: ++ --
Pointer Operators: * &
Scope Resolution Operator: ::


q3. Explain abstraction using a real-world example.

ans. 
Abstraction in C++ is the concept of hiding complex implementation details while exposing only the necessary features.

Example: ATM Machine
When using an ATM, we just insert a card, enter a PIN, and withdraw cash.
we don't need to know how the machine processes transactions internally.
