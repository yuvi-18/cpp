/*
q1. Let age = 10, height = 45 solve the following expression for K= (age < 12 && height < 48) ||(age > 65 && height > 72)

ans.
since age is less than 12 which is true and height is also less than 48 so result will be true for left side and false for right side.
thus k is true.


q2. Demonstrate differences between character arrays and strings.

ans. 
Character Arrays: Declared as a fixed-size array (e.g., char arr[] = "Hello";) where the memory size is limited to what you specify.

Strings: Declared using the std::string class (e.g., std::string str = "Hello";) which automatically manages memory and can resize as needed.
