Primitive Data Types: Basic, built-in types (e.g., int, char, double, bool).

Derived Data Types: Formed from primitives (or other types), such as arrays, pointers, references, and functions.

User-Defined Data Types: Created by programmers to model more complex data; examples include struct, class, union.


q2. How do you perform input/output operations in C++?

ans. 
Output: Use std::cout with the << operator to display text or data on the screen.
Input: Use std::cin with the >> operator to read data from the keyboard.
