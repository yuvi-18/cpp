/*
q1. State the reasons for Object-Oriented Programming to be important for software development?

ans.
Encapsulation: It groups related data and functions, leading to modular code.
Reusability: It lets you reuse existing code through classes.
Inheritance: It allows classes to inherit from others, reducing redundancy.
Polymorphism: It enables common interfaces for different data types.
Abstraction: It hides complex details and exposes only necessary parts.

q2. Write five differences between procedural approach and Object Oriented Approach of programming.

ans.
Structure:
Procedural: Uses a sequence of functions and procedures.
OOP: Organizes code into objects that encapsulate data and behavior.

Data Handling:
Procedural: Data often exists separately and is passed between functions.
OOP: Data is bundled with methods within objects, enhancing encapsulation.

Reusability:
Procedural: Reusability is achieved via functions.
OOP: Inheritance and polymorphism make reusing and extending code easier.

Modularity:
Procedural: Modules are functions, which may become complex as the project grows.
OOP: Classes naturally modularize code, making maintenance and scaling simpler.

Design Approach:
Procedural: Centers on step-by-step procedures.
OOP: Mimics real-world entities, modeling systems as interacting objects.
