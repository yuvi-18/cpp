/*
q1. How do different types of operators in C++ (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, etc.) contribute to efficient programming, and in what scenarios might their misuse lead to unexpected results?

ans. 
Efficiency: C++ operators are designed to work close to the hardware, making arithmetic, conditional logic, and bit manipulation fast and efficient.

Contribution:
Arithmetic operators perform fast math operations.
Relational operators enable quick decision-making.
Logical operators combine and optimize condition checks with short-circuiting.
Bitwise operators allow for high-speed low-level data manipulation.

Potential Misuse: Incorrect use (like mixing up = with ==, confusing & with &&, or misunderstanding operator precedence) can lead to bugs and unexpected results in your programs.
