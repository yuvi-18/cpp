q1. How does the concept of encapsulation in OOP help improve the security and manageability of a software system? Can you think of an example from your own experience where encapsulation could be useful?

ans. Encapsulation in OOP is like when we put all the info and stuff about something together in one place, like a class. Then, we control how other parts of our program can mess with that stuff by setting up rules. This makes things more secure because other parts can't just go in and change things directly. 
like a phone. All the complicated electronics and software are inside, and we only interact with it through the screen and buttons. The inside stuff is "encapsulated."


q2. In Object-Oriented Programming, we often talk about inheritance and how it allows for code reuse. How do you think inheritance can lead to better or worse design decisions in a project? Can you think of a situation where using inheritance might not be the best choice?

ans. Inheritance in OOP is like when a new class can "borrow" stuff (like variables and functions) from an old class. This is cool because we don't have to write the same code again, which saves time and makes things look cleaner. So, it can lead to a better design by making the code more organized and easier to understand since we are building upon existing stuff. 
A situation where using inheritance might not be the best choice in our project is when we just want to use a little bit of functionality from another class, but not everything. In that case, it might be better for us to just create an object of that class inside our new class and use its functions that way.Â
