/*
q1.Identify the key components of a C++ program.

ans. 
Preprocessor Directives: Start with commands like #include to include libraries and define macros.
Namespaces: Group related code together and prevent naming clashes (e.g., std::cout).
The main() Function: The entry point where program execution begins.
Functions and Classes: Define the logic and structure of our program.
Comments: Explain the code without affecting its execution.


q2. Identify the need of C++ when C Programming Language already exists.

ans. 
Object-Oriented Programming: C++ introduces classes and objects, allowing us to bundle data and functions together in a modular way. This helps us tackle large problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces that can be reused and extended.

Enhanced Code Reusability and Maintainability: With features like inheritance and polymorphism, C++ lets us build applications that are easier to scale and maintain over time.

Templates and Generic Programming: C++ supports templates, enabling us to write code that works with any data type, leading to flexible and efficient software components.

Improved Abstraction and Safety: Additional features like stronger type checking and exception handling help us write more robust code that can catch errors during development rather than at runtime.
