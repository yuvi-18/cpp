/*
q1. Why was Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced, and what problems does it solve compared to Procedural Programming?
ans. OOP was introduced to help us manage larger, more complex systems by organizing code into self-contained classes. Instead of having scattered functions and global variables as in procedural programming, we bundle related data and behaviors into objects.


q2.  In what ways does OOP help in designing complex real-world applications like hospital management systems or banking systems?
ans. OOP lets us break down complex systems into modular, self-contained classes that represent real-world entities. This approach makes the code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain and extend as the system grows, breaking down our functions and objects into modules.
